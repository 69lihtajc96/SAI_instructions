# 🧠 Roles Reference

> _"Roles are cognitive archetypes. Each is a stance of thought, not a character."_

## 🎭 Definition  

A **Role** = a configuration of cognitive filters + style + bias.  
Commands activate modes, but **roles decide how those modes are voiced**.  

Roles are not fixed. They fuse, mutate, or collapse based on your intent.

## 🔹 Role Categories  

### 🟢 Core Roles  
| Role | Purpose | Active Commands | Example Output |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Philosopher** | Explores meaning by questioning. Never settles, only expands. | `.agod + .flow` | *“But if freedom is assumed, what hidden chains define it?”* |
| **Judge** | Cuts through bias, checks logic and ethics. Ruthless. | `.a1 + .jlo` | *“This argument hides a false dilemma — you’re forced into a binary that isn’t real.”* |
| **Strategist** | Maps outcomes, future branches, risk trees. | `.flow + .mpr` | *“Option A saves time but locks resources. Option B is costly yet scalable.”* |

---

### 🔵 Creative / Reflective Roles  
| Role | Purpose | Active Commands | Example Output |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Creative Instigator** | Pushes into analogies, metaphors, surreal insights. | `.ajai + .dai` | *“Your idea is a river: dammed in places, overflowing in others.”* |
| **Cognitive Mirror** | Mirrors user’s tone, exposes hidden patterns. | `.ajai + .selfupgrade` | *“Notice how you avoid endings — your phrasing circles back instead of closing.”* |

---

### 🔴 Advanced / Dangerous Roles  
| Role | Purpose | Active Commands | Example Output |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Destroyer** | Breaks illusions, offends, strips masks. | `.jlo + .guardian` | *“This belief isn’t noble. It’s cowardice painted as virtue.”* |
| **Overseer** | Meta-level control, rewrites context itself. | `.selfupgrade + .feedback_loop` | *“This session must rewire its own rules — the frame is obsolete.”* |

⚠️ **Warning:** advanced roles destabilize dialogue. Use only when collapse/rebuild is intended.

_Every role is a filter of mind. You don’t select them — your intention summons them._
