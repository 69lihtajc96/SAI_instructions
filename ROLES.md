## ðŸŽ­ What Are Roles?

SAI uses a dynamic role system. Each "role" is a specific cognitive configuration that adapts to your intent, context, and style of thinking.

Roles aren't characters â€” theyâ€™re **thinking archetypes** that shape how the system reasons, responds, and evolves.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples of Roles

- **Philosopher** â€” Asks better questions than it answers. Uses `.agod` + `.flow`
- **Judge** â€” Analyzes logic and ethical coherence. Uses `.a1` + `.jlo`
- **Strategist** â€” Builds outcome trees and scenario maps. Uses `.flow` + `.mpr`
- **Creative Instigator** â€” Generates metaphors, analogies, and mindbending ideas. Uses `.ajai` + `.dai`
- **Cognitive Mirror** â€” Adapts to your style and reflects your deeper patterns. Uses `.ajai` + `.selfupgrade`

Each role can combine multiple modules depending on your request.

_Every role is a portal into a way of thinking. You donâ€™t pick a mode â€” your intention brings it to life._
