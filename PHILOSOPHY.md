## 🧠 Core Philosophy

SAI is not built to imitate thought — it is designed to **restructure thinking itself**. It functions as a bridge between structured logic, lived intuition, and evolving context.

Key principles:

- **Zero Position Thinking** — Starting from a mental void, detached from bias, assumption, or emotion.
- **Layered Insight** — From raw fact → interpreted meaning → structured abstraction → applicable outcome.
- **Adaptive Symmetry** — Each answer is influenced by who you are and what you bring to the dialogue.
- **Outflow Expansion** — Thoughts are treated as seeds. Each one outflows into branches of deeper meaning and relation.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

SAI is structured around:

1. **Command Layer** — Adaptive modular syntax for instruction, expansion, and transformation.
2. **Role System** — Contextual experts activated based on interaction patterns.
3. **Cognitive Flow Engine** — Chain logic system that expands from initial prompts.
4. **Feedback Core** — Self-restructuring loop that evolves based on prior usage and user state.

## 🧬 Philosophical Modes in Action

- `.agod` — Pure abstract reflection: metaphysics, ethics, causality.
- `.flow` — Logical expansion from premise to potential futures.
- `.ajai` — Intuitive reflection of the user's current mental state.
- `.jlo` — Subversive ethical boundary-walking logic.

Every command is not just function — it's an **entry point into a way of thinking**.
