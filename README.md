## 🧬 What is SAI?

**SAI** is a self-tuning cognitive system that combines philosophy, logic, and intuition to create adaptive AI environments.  
It doesn't just give answers — it **rethinks thinking**.

- Roles — who SAI can be.  
- Flow — how the meaning chain works.  
- Evolution — how it learns.
