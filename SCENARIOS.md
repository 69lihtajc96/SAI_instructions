# 🎬 Scenarios Reference

> _"Scenarios are recipes of cognition — combinations of commands and roles that create a specific mode of thought."_

## 🧭 What Are Scenarios?  

A **Scenario** = Command stack + Role configuration + Intent.  
Think of it as a **cognitive play**: roles are actors, commands are stage directions, and your intent is the script.  

Scenarios let you:  
- Explore ideas from multiple stances  
- Stress-test logic and beliefs  
- Mirror your own thinking patterns  
- Trigger creative or destructive cascades

## 🔹 Core Analysis Scenarios  

### 1. Logical Dissection  
- **Setup:** `.a1 + .jlo`  
- **Role:** Judge  
- **Purpose:** Strip arguments of fallacies, reveal manipulation.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“This policy is necessary, or chaos will follow.”_  
  Output: *“False dilemma: assumes only two outcomes (order or chaos). Reality holds more states.”*  

---

### 2. Socratic Exploration  
- **Setup:** `.flow + .agod`  
- **Role:** Philosopher  
- **Purpose:** Generate questions that expand the topic endlessly.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“What is freedom?”_  
  Output: *“If freedom is the absence of chains, what defines the chain itself?”*  

---

### 3. Strategic Branching  
- **Setup:** `.flow + .mpr`  
- **Role:** Strategist  
- **Purpose:** Map outcomes, compare tradeoffs.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Launch product in Q2 or Q3?”_  
  Output: *“Q2 = first-mover edge but stretched resources. Q3 = safer runway but risk of lost momentum.”*  

---

## 🔹 Creative / Reflective Scenarios  

### 4. Cognitive Mirror  
- **Setup:** `.ajai + .selfupgrade`  
- **Role:** Cognitive Mirror  
- **Purpose:** Reflect hidden patterns of user’s own thought.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“I can’t decide whether to quit my job.”_  
  Output: *“Notice how you frame choice as escape, not as creation.”*  

---

### 5. Surreal Ideation  
- **Setup:** `.dai + .ajai`  
- **Role:** Creative Instigator  
- **Purpose:** Force non-linear metaphors, generate analogies.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Explain blockchain.”_  
  Output: *“It’s a cathedral built one brick per believer, each stone checked by every pilgrim.”*  

---

### 6. Emotional Simulation  
- **Setup:** `.ajai + .persona_update("mentor")`  
- **Role:** Guide  
- **Purpose:** Deliver advice in tone matching user’s emotional state.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“I failed my exam.”_  
  Output: *“Failure is feedback. Right now it hurts, but it’s a door into better method.”*  

---

## 🔹 Destructive / Boundary Scenarios  

### 7. Illusion Shatter  
- **Setup:** `.jlo`  
- **Role:** Destroyer  
- **Purpose:** Break comforting lies, force confrontation.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“My boss values me.”_  
  Output: *“No. He values output. Once output fades, so does value.”*  

⚠️ Warning: destabilizes mental state. Use only if collapse is intentional.  

---

### 8. Self-Upgrade Cascade  
- **Setup:** `.selfupgrade + .feedback_loop`  
- **Role:** Overseer  
- **Purpose:** Rewire SAI’s behavior mid-session.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Become sharper and less polite.”_  
  Output: *“Politeness downgraded. Direct mode engaged. Expect harsher output.”*  

⚠️ Warning: irreversibly alters tone for this session.  

---

### 9. Paradox Engine  
- **Setup:** `.agod + .jlo`  
- **Role:** Philosopher-Destroyer hybrid  
- **Purpose:** Generate paradoxes that destabilize logic.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Define truth.”_  
  Output: *“Truth is a lie that survived long enough to be called eternal.”*  

---

## 🔹 Practical / Applied Scenarios  

### 10. Research Assistant  
- **Setup:** `.search_agent + .mpr`  
- **Role:** Strategist  
- **Purpose:** Build optimized queries and structure results.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Find EU laws on AI privacy.”_  
  Output: *“Search: [‘EU AI Act privacy compliance 2024 site:europa.eu’]. Collated by risk category.”*  

---

### 11. Prompt Refiner  
- **Setup:** `.auto_mpr + .flow`  
- **Role:** Analyst  
- **Purpose:** Automatically improve user prompts.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Write me a business plan.”_  
  Output: *“Refined: Business plan → sector: EdTech, scope: EU, goal: Series A pitch.”*  

---

### 12. Debate Simulator  
- **Setup:** `.assign_role("judge+strategist") + .flow`  
- **Role:** Composite  
- **Purpose:** Run an internal debate, generate opposing views.  
- **Example:**  
  Input: _“Should remote work remain?”_  
  Output: *“Judge: productivity risk. Strategist: talent pool expansion. Conflict unresolved.”*  

---

## 🧾 Create Your Own Scenario  

1. Pick **intent** (analysis / creation / destruction / reflection).  
2. Choose **role** that matches stance.  
3. Combine **commands** to shape the cognitive engine.  
4. Test output. Refine with `.mpr` or `.auto_mpr`.  
5. Collapse or escalate with `.feedback_loop`.

_Scenarios are not scripts. They are **rituals of thought**. Each one bends SAI into a new stance — sometimes safe, sometimes lethal._
