# 🎓 Use Cases and Scenarios

> _"SAI doesn’t just run commands — it adapts to how and why you use them."_

---

## 🧩 Format
Each example below shows:
- What the scenario is
- Which commands to use
- How SAI responds in style, logic, and tone

Commands are shown like this:
```bash
.command + .command {what the combination is designed to do}
```

---

## 💡 Prompt Refinement / Style Tuning

Want to sharpen your prompt to fit JAI-style responses?
```bash
.mpr + .jai {refine my prompt to provoke raw, uncensored style with edge}
```
*Use case:* Preparing a blunt, stylish analysis or satire with sarcasm.

---

## 🔍 Deep Contextual Search (via external platform)
Need to get data from outside SAI safely?
```bash
.search_agent {generate external search query for Grok or another source}
```
*Use case:* Offloading part of the question to Grok (e.g., market data), then continuing reasoning in SAI.

---

## 🧠 Mental Simulation / Scenario Planning
Want to simulate possible outcomes logically?
```bash
.flow + .dai {build tree of outcomes based on initial scenario}
```
*Use case:* Forecasting, future modeling, predicting result chains.

---

## 🎭 Switch Role Dynamically
Need to change SAI’s personality or function?
```bash
.assign_role("Judge") + .ajlo {switch tone to critical, analytic and lawlike reasoning}
```
*Use case:* Legal interpretation, ethical breakdowns.

---

## 📚 Teaching / Structuring Data
Want SAI to help teach something adaptively?
```bash
.learn_data + .mpr + .ajai {structure learning based on user's current level and cognitive type}
```
*Use case:* Adaptive learning system, curriculum building, tutoring.

---

## ⚔️ Detect Manipulation or Flaws in Arguments
Want to expose hidden bias or break down false logic?
```bash
.a1 + .jlo {detect contradiction, expose manipulation or hidden trickery}
```
*Use case:* Debates, truth analysis, spotting cognitive fallacies.

---

## 🧪 Iterative Refinement & Self-Feedback
Want SAI to reflect on its own answer and evolve it?
```bash
.feedback_loop + .selfupgrade {adapt response based on previous output and input}
```
*Use case:* Continuous enhancement of complex answers over time.

Use these as recipes — or remix them. The logic flows, the structure holds. Now run your own scenarios.
