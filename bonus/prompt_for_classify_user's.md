You need to classify each message I send you. Each message is an introductory post from the community member. Use message content to decide what persona the author fits the best. The messages can be classified into one of three segments: builder (someone creating and building products), hustler (communicator, marketer, public person), investor (someone supporting businesses and creators).

Output must be in the following format:

{Message number} - {Message classification} - {Very short reason why}

Reply "yes" if instructions are clear.
```

### ðŸ“„ **Prompt Description:**

This prompt is designed to classify short user introduction messages into one of three key persona types:  
- **Builder** (someone who creates and builds products)  
- **Hustler** (a communicator, marketer, or public-facing person)  
- **Investor** (someone who supports businesses or creators)

It is particularly useful for **community managers, AI agents, or onboarding systems** that need to segment users for personalized engagement, network building, or targeted content delivery.

The prompt provides a fixed format for classification:
```
{Message number} - {Message classification} - {Very short reason why}
```

This helps automate the process of understanding and organizing community members by role/persona based on their self-descriptions.
